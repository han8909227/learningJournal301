# HB Code 301 - Day 3

<hr />

<p>
Today we learned to use jQuery for event listening and handling. It is very handy to use call back functions for event handling, and I can surly see the benefit of functional programming. Overall I like the idea of modularity since it separates and modularize chunks of code that would other wise be on one file, which would be a mess trying to edit with.
