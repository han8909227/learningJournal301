# HB Code 301 - Day 10

<hr />

<p>
This Friday we saw the introduction to functional programming, although I have been using certain functional programming methods during code war assignments after reading some docs I now have a deeper understanding towards some of the methods. For an example, I did not know about the parameters .reduce() can have (accumulator, current value and current index). In my opinion FP styled code are difficult to read, and hard to wrap your head around the logic but the elegance is worth the time effort.
