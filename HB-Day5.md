# HB Code 301 - Day 5

<hr />

<p>
This week I've learned many uses of jQuery, such as append elements dynamically. Many lines of JS codes that we used to use for DOM manipulating now can be done easily with jQuery, such as event listening, add/change id/class, for loop to append contents, etc. jQuery seems to be the answer of DOM manipulation and handling.
