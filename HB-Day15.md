# HB Code 301 - Day 15

<hr />

<p>
We are 3/4 way into the 301 course, meaning it's almost project week! For the final project we are required to build a site that sends user request as an ajax request to an external API, which would return a response to that specific request, then render onto the DOM. This level of interaction shows the powerfulness of external APIs, and the capability they are able to do without accessing a database outside of your computer. For project idea we are thinking of making a site that allows user to check events/concerts nearby their location using Ticket Master's own API.
