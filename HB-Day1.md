# HB Code 301 - Day 1

<hr />


<p>
Today is the first day of 301 it was exciting to meet some new classmates, I am excited too as we leaning towards back-end technology.
Learned about responsive web design and the importance of taking mobile/tablet users, or even users with higher/lower monitor resolution into consideration when coding for a web page, I particular enjoy learning the media queries it essentially acted as an if statement allowing certain property to exhibit on an element under certain condition(s). SMACSS seem to be a good idea as well, splitting up the CSS into multiple files for easier management and editing purpose.
