# HB Code 301 - Day 6

<hr />

<p>
Today marked an important moment as we learned to use AJAX, a tool that allows us to send request for information or specific data we desire from external API. What is cool is that within AJAX code we could check if there the data we are requesting already exist in the local storage, and set them into local storage after obtaining them. This approach allows more functionality and data to render to the user without reaching out to the external API for solutions each time.
