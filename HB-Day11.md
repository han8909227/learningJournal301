# HB Code 301 - Day 11

<hr />

<p>
Today's topic was about using page.js combined with jQuery to render part of the DOM in a single page application. Meaning instead of handling a click on an anchor tag we now can set the anchor with a href that is then handle by the routing (using page.js) to carrry out a specific action such as hide/show.
